# Dibs

A fullstack javascript application that helps families manage secondary properties that they wish to share with other other family members. Users can share and reserve properties as well as see monthly availabities of each. Supports basic CRUD operations. Users can: 

* Create - Add properties and reservations
* Read   - Get a list of all properties and reservations 
* Update - Update property info
* Delete - Delete properties and reservations

## Demo

- [Live Demo](https://dibs-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation

Being part of a large family that continues to grow with each new generation, it was becoming increasingly more challenging to share and make the most of secondary properties / vacation homes without stepping on one anothers toes. What was needed was a central system for listing properties to make them available for family members to reserve.
